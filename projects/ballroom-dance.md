### Overview

As a computer science student at UH Manoa, school and professional work take up a majority of my time. I was looking for a creative outlet and 
a way to socialize when I heard of the Ballroom Dance Club from a friend. Since joining, I have learned multiple styles of dance– such as rumba, waltz, 
cha-cha, and swing –I have performed with the club this past December, and I will be competing at the Aloha Ball in February 2026.

### Styles of Dance

In ballroom dance, there are four main styles of dance: American Smooth, American Rhythm, International Standard,and International Latin. Within these main categories
are dances such as Waltz, Tango, Rumba, Swing, Cha-cha, Foxtrot, and more. The UHMBDC is very beginner friendly and teaches 2+ styles of dance a semester.
